# TS_GPOupdate_program
This script is designed for deployment via Group Policy.
When new program config files are released, they need to be manually copied into a local file share.
Assign a fileshare and an admin user to the script, and then attach to a file replacement group policy object. Designed to copy the contents of the share into end user app folders.
